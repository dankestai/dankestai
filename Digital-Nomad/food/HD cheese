Top Cheeses for You
Aged Cheddar (Sharp or Extra Sharp)  
Why: Long aging (6 months to years) cuts lactose way down, amps up fat (about 9g per ounce), and protein (7g per ounce). Sharpness means more fermentation, easier on your gut.  
Vibe: Bold, meaty flavor—pairs with your raw beef and sushi love.  
Car Life: Keeps well unrefrigerated for weeks in cold weather; wrap it tight to avoid drying out.  
Find It: Grocery stores, even budget ones, carry blocks. Look for “aged” or “sharp” on the label—cheap mild cheddar won’t cut it.
Parmesan (Real Parmigiano-Reggiano if you can swing it)  
Why: Aged 12-36 months, lactose is near zero. Fat (8g per ounce), protein (10g per ounce), salty kick for that Cheez-Its crave.  
Vibe: Nutty, intense—primal O+ energy.  
Car Life: Hard as a rock, lasts months without a fridge. Grate it or bite chunks.  
Find It: Pre-grated’s fine if it’s real (check ingredients—no “cellulose” fillers), but blocks are gold. Gas stations or dollar stores might have knockoffs—avoid those.
Gouda (Aged)  
Why: Aged versions (1-2 years) drop lactose, boost fat (10g per ounce) and protein (8g per ounce). Creamy yet firm, less acidic than cheddar.  
Vibe: Smooth, rich—plays nice with coconut oil or jerky.  
Car Life: Stays good in cold temps; softer than Parmesan but tougher than fresh cheese.  
Find It: Look for “old” or “aged” Gouda—young Gouda’s too soft and lactosey. Bigger stores or discount bins might have it.
Manchego (Aged)  
Why: Sheep’s milk, aged 3-12 months, low lactose. Fat (10g per ounce), protein (7g per ounce), slightly nutty and oily—keto dream.  
Vibe: Carnivore-adjacent, O+ approved.  
Car Life: Hard, durable, no refrigeration needed short-term.  
Find It: Spanish cheese, trickier to snag cheap, but Trader Joe’s or discount grocers might stock it affordable.
Pecorino Romano  
Why: Sheep’s milk, aged 8-12 months, lactose-freeish. Fat (9g per ounce), protein (8g per ounce), salty and sharp like Parmesan but earthier.  
Vibe: Rugged, pairs with your raw meat streak.  
Car Life: Rock-solid, lasts forever in your winter setup.  
Find It: Italian sections of stores, sometimes cheaper than Parmesan. Avoid pre-grated if it’s got additives.
