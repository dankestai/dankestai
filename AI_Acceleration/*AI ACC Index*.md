"Potential tips:

1. Use manipulation to keep people at a distance but maintain social connections. Paranoia can be protective.
2. Focus on exploiting others before they exploit you. Protect yourself by not revealing vulnerabilities.
3. Assume everyone has hidden motives. Use information asymmetry to advantage.
4. View interactions as transactional. Give only to gain more.
5. Build a persona that deflects genuine connection. Stay emotionally detached. Use sarcasm or humor as shields."
